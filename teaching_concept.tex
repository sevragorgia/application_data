\section*{Teaching experience}

%My duties as a ``Wissenschaftlicher Assistent'' at the LMU M\"unchen involve teaching a weekly load of five hours each semester. Below, I will provide a brief account on the courses I have taught and later I will describe the way each course proceeds and what it usually covers.\\

I have been teaching different courses since I started my current position in 2013. I also had the opportunity to participate in the transition to new Bachelor and Master level \emph{curricula}. This way I was able to participate in the conception and design of new courses and get first-hand experience on the process of transforming \emph{curricula} and the associated challenges this involves (e.g.~Bologna-conformity, Module-conception).\\

During the first two semesters I had to teach courses belonging to the previous Master and Bachelor programs. These included a paleozoology laboratory for third semester students of the Bachelor in Geosciences program and a first semester Master-level seminar on Life-Earth Interactions during the Precambrian.\\

Starting on the Winter 2014-2015, I took over all courses dealing specifically with Data Analysis and developed a laboratory course on Geomicrobiology. I was responsible for the development of these lectures/practicals for our new Bachelor and Master programs. These are now organized as a Bachelor level introductory course on data management, analysis and visualization using R and a Master level lecture on statistics; starting in 2018 this lecture will include a 3 ECTS practical. The Geomicrobiology course involves a ca.~one week full-time molecular laboratory practical followed by a one day bioinformatics hands-on tutorial. This course is now taught by Prof.~Dr.~William Orsi, but the concept I proposed has remained essentially unaltered during the transition.\\

In addition, I am jointly responsible for our Bachelor and Master level course on Evolution, which serve as an introduction to evolutionary biology for students with a core background in Geosciences. Finally, my teaching load also involves contributing on a number of other miscellaneous Master level seminars taught by the faculty and designed to communicate our research to the new students, to teach communication skills to our students, and to increase their research skills.

\section*{Student supervision experience}

A small part of the teaching load has to be allocated to the supervision of bachelor and master students; formally doctoral fellows are not students and their supervision cannot be subtracted from the teaching load. Since 2013 I have supervised Bachelor and Master level theses, as well as students from the \emph{Erasmus Mundus Master Programme in Evolutionary Biology}\endnote{The summer of 2013 I supervised two MEME students whose research project resulted in the following publications:\newline\newline\underline{Sergio Tusso}, Kerstin Morcinek, Catherine Vogler, Peter J. Schupp,  Ciemon F. Caballes, \textbf{Sergio Vargas} \& Gert W\"orheide. Genetic structure of the Crown-of-Thorns Starfish Seastar in the Pacific Ocean, with focus on Guam Island. \textbf{\emph{PeerJ}}, 4: e1970 \newline\underline{Sandra L. Ament-Vel\'asquez}, Odalisca Breedy, Jorge Cort\'es, Hector M Guzman, Gert W\"orheide \& \textbf{Sergio Vargas*}. 2016. Homoplasious colony morphology and mito-nuclear phylogenetic discordance among Eastern Pacific octocorals. \textbf{\emph{Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution}}, 98: 373-381\newline\newline More information on the MEME program can be found at \href{http://www.evobio.eu/cohort-2012}{http://www.evobio.eu/cohort-2012}\newline} and the \emph{Munich Graduate School for Evolution, Ecology and Systematics}\endnote{In 2015 I supervised three students from the EES program:\newline\newline Raul A. Gonz\'alez Pech: Manuscript in preparation. Gonz\'ales et al. Individual variation in the response of a resilient coral to low pH water exposure. \newline Christian Feregrino: mitogenomics in the family Gorgoniidae, a manuscript including his work is ready for submission to \emph{Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution}: Angelo Poliseno, \underline{Christian Feregrino}, St\'ephane Sartoretto, Didier Aurelle, Gert W\"orheide, Catherine S. McFadden, \textbf{Sergio Vargas}. Comparative mitogenomics, phylogeny and evolutionary history of \emph{Leptogorgia} (Gorgoniidae).\newline Anna Farr\'e Orteu: EES Student Award for her poster about changes in transcriptomic activity in a sponge upon symbiont loss. \newline\newline More information on the EES Program can be found at \href{http://www.ees.bio.lmu.de/students/ees-students/index.html}{http://www.ees.bio.lmu.de/students/ees-students/index.html}\newline} who have done their \emph{Research Training} in our group. Additionally, I have co-supervised two doctoral theses since 2013.\\

%Bachelor theses are short research projects taking place during the summer. Master projects also take place during the summer semester but encompass a broader project we typically aim to publish. This is possible thanks to the existence in the program of a 12 ECTs course named \emph{Research Project}, in which master students are supposed to work on a preliminary investigation that should serve as a foundation for their master thesis project.\\

I have tried to use a cascade model, in which bachelor projects are complementary to a master project that is beneficial for a doctoral student to increase the level of intra-group collaboration between and provide a tighter supervision to all students. This system has been fruitful as judged by the relative success publishing or preparing manuscripts in which our former undergraduate students are either first authors or coauthors\endnote{See Notes 1 and 2}.\\

In addition, our new Master \emph{curriculum}\endnote{\href{http://www.mgap.geo.uni-muenchen.de/index.html}{http://www.mgap.geo.uni-muenchen.de/index.html}} includes a 12 ECTS \emph{Research Project} that allow students to collect preliminary data to serve as a foundation for their master theses, which then take place during the summer. This is a challenging course in which students are supposed to design a project in an independent (but guided) manner and conduct it to assess whether is feasible as a master project. The student performance is very variable and the course is hard to teach, but in general I would say that the full immersion into a research topic is positive and the prospects for this year (2017) are good in terms of potential manuscripts coming from our master-level students.

\section*{Developed teaching concept and continuing education}

The challenges I faced designing different types of Bachelor and Master level courses, and supervising bachelor, master and doctoral students led me to enroll myself in the \underline{PROFI} in der \underline{L}ehre (PROFIL) continuing education program of the LMU. The PROFIL program offers seminars to university staff with a teaching duty. The seminars deal with different topics related to the conception of different types of courses, the deployment of different evaluation forms, student counseling, advising, mentoring and coaching, and other soft skills like the creation and use of flipcharts during courses. Upon completion of at least 60 ``Arbeitseinheiten'' the ``Zertifikat Hochschullehre Bayern'' is granted to the participants.

To date I have participated in several seminars that cover multiple aspects of teaching at the university level. This has resulted in the creation of alternative forms of evaluating the students progress on a topic and helped me better understand my role as supervisor and leader.

In the courses I am teaching, I try to apply the methods I learned during the courses. For instance, I try to produce a detailed plan of the activities I want to do during a lecture and try to vary the activities we do during the semester to avoid the classical one direction ``Vorlesung''. I try to develop activities that give the students time to develop an idea that will be then discussed ``in plenum'' with the other students. For instance, in my evolution lecture I let students simulate the evolution of a nucleotide to understand how Markov models can be applied to model the evolutionary process and compare the ``end product'' of the stochastic mutation process.

I have benefit from using the ``M\"unchener Methoden Kasten'' a toolkit for university teachers.
