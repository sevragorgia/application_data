My previous research was mostly focused on the systematics and diversity of sponges and soft-corals. I still work on these topics but my interest drifted in the last years toward the study of the interaction between sponges and their symbionts. My current research can be divided in two main lines I drew when I started my Habilitation in 2014. Both try to leverage new (short- and long-read) sequencing technologies to answer evolutionary question in sponges and octocorals. I am interested in understanding how environmental change related stress factors affect the sponge holobiont and whether variations in the symbiotic community of sponges may lead to an increase in the fitness of the entire system. I am also interested in the role played by gene flow as a force that can counteract natural selection at a local level in octocorals and sponges.\\

Below I outline the main research topics I would like to further develop in D\"usseldorf.

\section*{Holobiont adaptomics and response to climate change}
\subsection*{Freshwater sponges}

\emph{Spongilla lacustris} is a freshwater sponge commonly found across Europe. Freshwater sponges produce special overwintering structures called ``gemmulae'' that can be collected and kept in the laboratory in a dormant state for long periods of time. Sponges can be produced by letting the gemmulae hatch, and the hatched sponges are easy to keep in the laboratory for experimentation.\\

Only scarce information exist about the bacterial symbiotic community associated with \emph{S.~lacustris}\footnote{Gernert et al.~2005.~Microb.~Ecol.~50:206-212} and no information exist to date on the geographical variation of the \emph{S.~lacustris} microbiome. In addition, within a single population \emph{S.~lacustris} can be found harboring unicellular algae of the genus \emph{Chlorella} or, on the contrary, the algae may not be present. The effect of presence/absence of \emph{Chlorella} on the symbiotic bacterial community of \emph{S.~lacustris} also remains to be determined. \\

I would like to conduct future research on this system to assess:
\begin{enumerate}
\item what are the connectivity patterns between populations of \emph{S.~lacustris},
\item how is natural selection at local scales, due to exposure to contrasting local environments (e.g.~alpine lakes \emph{vs.}~Mediterranean freshwater systems), shaping genome evolution in different populations of \emph{S.~lacustris},
\item how does the microbiome of \emph{S.~lacustris} change along latitudinal and environmental gradients, and
\item how do different \emph{S.~lacustris} holobionts respond and adapt to climate-change induced stress factors.
\end{enumerate}

To answer these questions, I would like to establish a collection of \emph{S.~lacustris} from multiple localities in Europe and use it together with data I have generated as part of my current research on sponge genomics and transcriptomics. These data could be used in the future to assemble a draft genome of this species. The access to genomic information and the broad distribution of \emph{S. lacustris} make this species an attractive system to assess the evolutionary consequences of the interactions between the sponge and its symbionts (the holobiont).

\subsection*{Cyanosponges}

Cyanosponges are sponges that have a symbiotic association with cyanobacteria. These sponges occur in shallow marine environments world-wide. I have been working with a common cyanosponge that can be easily cultured and manipulated in marine aquaria. Curiously, the taxonomic affiliation of this aquarium sponge is not well established yet.\\

With this system I have tried to characterize the microbial community inhabiting the sponge and currently pursue to close some of the symbiont genomes. I have assessed the response of the symbiotic community to bleaching (i.e.~loss of the symbiotic cyanobacteria). I have also assessed how bleaching affects the sponge transcriptome. I am currently analyzing the data I have produced and writing the manuscripts that communicate the results of this project, which represents a large part of my habilitation research.

Future research will use this system as a tractable model sponge holobiont for the study of the molecular basis of symbiont-host interaction and of the effects of climate-induced stress factors on it. I have already identified a number of candidate genes that constitute a basis for future experiments involving, for instance, \emph{in situ} hybridization to locate their expression and test whether cells actively expressing these genes are interacting with the symbionts or not.

\section*{Potential interaction with ongoing SFBs}

My main research now deals with the interaction between sponges and their symbionts. I am interested in establishing the mechanisms for the molecular cross-talk between these organisms. Sponges are well known by their secondary metabolites, some of which are synthesized by the symbiotic community inhabiting the sponge body. Because of this I think I could serve as a key partner for the study of the production of secondary metabolites under different environmental conditions and to establish the genomic/transcriptomic basis of metabolite production in sponges.\\

In addition, I think that a detailed characterization of the mechanisms used by sponges to interact with their symbionts requires interaction between fields and working groups and may inform other research areas. I have a fairly reliable sponge system that could be used in the future for this purpose and that I would like to further develop. I would be more than happy to expand the use of this system and to establish future collaboration to exploit this resource.


%\section*{Adaptation genomics in \emph{Leptogorgia sarmentosa}}

%The past two years we have used reduce representation libraries to rapidly gather genomic information of different species of octocorals and sponges. We worked first with eastern Pacific and later with Mediterranean octocorals, trying to move my research area to Europe as it is logistically easier to reach the Mediterranean than the eastern Pacific. In 2013 I secured funding from the LMU Excellent Junior Funds program to study the speciation genomics in \emph{Pacifigorgia}. Thanks to this funding our former doctoral student Dr. Angelo Poliseno generated SNP datasets for several species of \emph{Pacifigorgia} and for the Mediterranean octocoral \emph{Leptogorgia sarmentosa}.\\

%\emph{Leptogorgia sarmentosa} is the only representative of the genus in the Mediterranean. Our research shows that this species resulted from a recent speciation event that separated it from Atlantic \emph{Leptogorgia} species. The variable temperature regimes to which \emph{L.~sarmentosa} is exposed make this species an attractive model to study how its genome adapts to different enviromental conditions across the Mediterranean. With the data currently available coding regions of the genome under selection in \emph{L.~sarmentosa} can be identified. The easy access to \emph{L.~sarmentosa} populations under different water temperature regimes (e.g.~Cadiz vs. the Adriatic) makes this species an ideal target for field studies designed to determine how the expression of genes under selection changes between and within populations and whether these local adaptations increase the survival potential of the octocorals. In addition, the role of gene flow, as a force acting against natural selection, can be studied given the restricted geographic distribution of \emph{L.~sarmentosa} and relative discrete populations. I produced low coverage genome sequence data with which a genome size estimation can done and a strategy to sequence a (draft) genome of this species in the future can be developed.\\
